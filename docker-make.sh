#!/bin/bash
# docker-make.sh -- build the GW3 armhf binary inside a Docker container.
#
# Usage:
#   ./docker-make.sh            # build gw3_r36 + libclock_fix.so
#   ./docker-make.sh clean      # make clean
#   ./docker-make.sh portmaster # build the old-glibc (bullseye) binary too
#   ./docker-make.sh shell      # drop into the build container for debugging
#
# The cross toolchain lives in the image; the source is mounted read-write so
# the produced binaries land in this directory. SYSROOT=/ points the Makefile
# at the container's native armhf multiarch paths.
